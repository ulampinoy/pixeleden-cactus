I am back and super excited to talk about my adventure on learning, photography, technology and everything else.

## Looking Back

When I first launched Pixeleden and got myself hooked with web design it was the idea of writing sensible HTML and CSS. (Zen Garden, Hicksdesign, it was a small circle back then). Fast forward today, I have the same spark! Elegant HTML and CSS.

Pixeleden has been my portfolio and a test bed. A digital garden where I cultivate design ideas and play lab for learning techniques.

It is such a wonderful community where I learn and now a way of giving back is to share my journey and hoping to be useful to those getting started as I was a decade ago.
