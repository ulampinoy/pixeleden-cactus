This is the first post for **Link Pack Weekly!** Is a collection of the week's interesting and useful stuff I found or stumbled upon the Internet.

Cloudflare's privacy-first public DNS resolver is [now available as a mobile app](https://blog.cloudflare.com/1-thing-you-can-do-to-make-your-internet-safer-and-faster/) to easily use it to get faster, more private Internet experience. A must!

Google Chrome Labs project launched [VisBug,](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/projectvisbug) a Chrome extension that make any webpage feel like an artboard.

["Private by Design: â€¦"](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/) A post by Mozilla that explain in a comprehensive and illustrated way how they created Firefox Sync. Another compelling reason why I came back using Firefox as my defaulf browser.

[Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) is an image compression web app that allows you to dive into the advanced options provided by various image compressors.

I am using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as the site generator for Pixeleden. It is simple and reliable to get started with.
