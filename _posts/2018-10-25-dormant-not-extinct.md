It's so nice to be back again! Idle no more because today I am clearing the weeds and get it up running and live again.

### Web garden and online journal
Pixeleden has served me well as my online portfolio that showcase my work as a digital designer but soon I will be moving my portfolio in [my resum√© website](https://allanrey.es). Pixeleden then will be my blog to share ideas, resources and interesting stuff that I find useful. It will also be a sandbox to test ideas. Since it is a journal, I will also feature photographs I made and meant something to me.

### A work in progress
Continuous improvement, a practice we adhere at work is also something I will employ to approach the rebuilding Pixeleden.
